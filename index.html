	     <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>

         <p>This website was designed by me, Lucio HERVÃ‰, a IESEG Student who is also one of The Rock's biggest fan since I first knew him. Here is a little biography of who he is, from a profesionnel wrestler to one of the highest paid actor of Hollywood. 

         	Dwayne Johnson americano-canadian, was born 2 may 1972 in Hayward, California.

Coming from a wrestling family, he too became a wrestler. He was known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment until 2004 and then returned to competition from February 2011 until April 2013 and makes occasional appearances.
He began a career as an actor in the late 1990s and quickly moved into leading roles in the 2000s, becoming a movie star in his own right as the lead actor in numerous action films and then the highest paid actor in the world in 2016 and 2019 according to Forbes magazine. He is also one of the 100 most influential people in the world according to the Time 100 in 2016 and 2019.</p>
